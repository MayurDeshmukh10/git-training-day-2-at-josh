force push is a used to push local commits to a remote repository , overiting any commits that may have been made in the meantime.here commits made by other collaborators will be discarded and replaced with our changes.

command =>
git push origin <branch-name> --force

force push with lease adds a layer for protection witch will prevent other collaborators from  overiting our commits.

command =>
git push origin <branch_name> --force-with-lease

when we have to resolve conflicts before pushing the changes.
when we have made local commits thatwe want to push to remote,but we aware that remote branch has been updated sience last fetch.
if we use force pushwith lease our chenges will be merged cleanly.
