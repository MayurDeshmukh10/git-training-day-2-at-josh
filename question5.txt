--force:-
	This command overwrites a remote branch with the local branch

--force-with-lease:-
	This is safer than --force as it will not overwrite any work on 
	the remote branch if more commits were added to the remote branch.

Using this flag, git checks if the remote version of the branch is the same
as the one you rebase, i.e. did someone push new commits when we were
rebasing. The push is then rejected if the remotes branch is changed.And 
then when pushing, it checks the version you started from and applies 
the changes only if the version it remembers matches the one currently on
the remote. So, you won’t accidentally overwrite a commit you’re not aware
of.
