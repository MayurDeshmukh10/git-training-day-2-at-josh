To combine two commits into a single commit , 'git rebase' and 'squash' command can be used 

e.g.
considiring following commit's
c1 => c2 => c3 => c4

git rebase -i HEAD-4 #list last 4 commits

#text editor will open 
# pick id1 Commit C2 
# pick id2 Commit C3 
# pick id3 Commit C4

to combine C2 and C3
change command from "pick" to "squash"
#squash id2 Commit c3
