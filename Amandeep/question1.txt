Cherry picking is an interactive git command that helps us to choose a particular commit to merge in our branch from another branch. This is helpful when we need to pick a commit by refernceto its commit_id, and append it into our current working branch. This can be useful for undoing any changes, or to remove any bugs. For example while working on a new feature branch a developer found a pre existing bug so they can create an exclusive commit to patch this bug and then switch to master branch and cherry pick this commit by its commit_id inorder to save other users from getting affected by the bug. This is a powerful command while working in teams.
