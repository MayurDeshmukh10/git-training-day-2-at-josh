Sometimes while working on a project, the data involved can be in large amounts that
can be around terabytes or petabytes even, henceforth the best way to scale our project 
is to have multiple remote repositories, for differnet purposes. Now ,if we have a single
remote available with us, then it is by default named as 'origin'. 
But to have  more than one remote repositories we need to rename the rigin as something else
and we do this by manually editing the git repository's configuration file where we wil add the 
second repository as a new remote source. And thus we can add multiple remote repositories, for a single project in the local repo.
