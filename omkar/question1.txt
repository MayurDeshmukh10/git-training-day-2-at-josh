cherry pick is used when you made some changes in branch2 and committed it and you want same changes in branch1 then cherry pick command is used.
 It is mainly used if you donâ€™t want to merge the whole branch and you want some of the commits.

 Steps:-
 first we create a file in branch2 and add and commit it. then by git log --oneline we copy the hash value of file.
 then we checkout to branch1 then in branch1 we use the command git cherry-pick <hash value> and paste the hash value to it.
 then the file will get updated to branch1 also.
