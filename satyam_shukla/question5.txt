ans.)Git will prevent you from overwriting remote commits that you don't have locally, to prevent you from losing work. However, you can use the "--force" option to override this behavior and overwrite the remote commits.

The "--force" option can be dangerous, because it can overwrite commits made by other people and cause problems for other developers working on the project. It should be used with caution and only when you are sure that you want to permanently overwrite the remote commits.
