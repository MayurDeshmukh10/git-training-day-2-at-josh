ans.)To set multiple remote repositories for the same project in Git, you can use the "git remote" command with the "add" subcommand. Here's an example of how you can do this:

Check the current remote repository for your project:


Check the current remote repository for your project:
Copy code
git remote -v
Add a new remote repository:
Copy code
git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>
Replace "<remote-name>" with a name for the remote repository (e.g., "upstream", "backup", etc.) and "<remote-url>" with the URL of the remote repository. For example:

Copy code
git remote add upstream https://github.com/upstream-user/repo.git
This will add a new remote repository called "upstream" with the URL "https://github.com/upstream-user/repo.git".

Verify that the new remote repository has been added:
Copy code
git remote -v
