The difference between the git push --force-with-lease and git push --force is the result.
Pushing changes with lease helps us avoid discarding changes pushed by other developers.
 
For using --force push use command :- $ git push --force origin
 
For using --force-with-lease us ecommand :- $ git push --force-with-lease origin

 
--force-with-lease is used when several developers are sharing a remote repository.
We use it when publishing our changes to avoid discarding changes pushed by other developers.
