Q4. How to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently Write command for it. 

To delete a commit or multiple commits permanently, we use git reset --hard command.

If we want to delete a single commit then use :- git reset --hard HEAD~1
It will go 1 commit back.

If we want to delete multiple commits then use :- git reset --hard HEAD~2
It will go 2 commits back.
