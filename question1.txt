Cherry pick is a powerful command that enables random Git commits to be picked by reference
and added to the current branch. We can also say that cherry picking is a process of picking
a commit from a branch and applying it to another.

There are many uses of cherry pick:-

1.In team collaboration
2.In case of bug fixing
3.To access the change in another branch without changing the current branch

Steps to do it:-

1.Go to the branch from where you want to get the commit from
2.There run the command git log to get the history of the commits
3.Now get the commit ID of the commit you want to cherry pick
4.Now go to the branch where you want to get the commit
5.Now run the command git cherry-pick <commit Id>. The commit will be added to the current
  branch
