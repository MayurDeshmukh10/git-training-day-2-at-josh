Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit. 

-> to combine 2 commits into 1 we use git interactive rebase.

-> git rebase -i HEAD~5   
here 5 is the index of the commit in which you want to combine from top

-> Now we can use stash or fix to merge them.
