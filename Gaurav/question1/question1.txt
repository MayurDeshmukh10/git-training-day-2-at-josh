Q1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it also write steps to do it.

-> cherry-pick is a command used to get a commit from other branch to the current branch using commit reference .

->let's understand with following example

-> A-B-C-D-  Branch 1
   |
   E-F-G-H-  Branch 2

->Let say above are the 2 branches, now the branch1 needs the commit F from the branch 2, it can be done by following command:

    git cherry-pick commit-reference-f

where "commit-reference-f" is the commit id of the commit F which can be found from git log.

->now the structure would look like:

-> A-B-C-D-F  Branch 1
   |
   E-F-G-H-  Branch 2
