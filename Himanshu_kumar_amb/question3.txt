Steps to merging multiple commits

1)You want to git rebase -i to perform an interactive rebase.

2) If you're currently on your "commit 1", and the commit you want to merge, "commit 2", 
is the previous commit, you can run git rebase -i HEAD~2, which will spawn an editor 
listing all the commits the rebase will traverse. 

3) You should see two lines starting with "pick".
To proceed with squashing, change the first word of the second line from "pick" to "squash". 
Then save your file, and quit. Git will squash your first commit into your second last commit.
