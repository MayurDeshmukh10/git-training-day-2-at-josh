Ans :
steps to add multiple remote origin :
1) Define a git remote which will point to multiple git remotes.
Say, we call it “all”: git remote add all REMOTE-URL-1.
2) Register 1st push URL: git remote set-url --add --push all REMOTE-URL-1.
3) Register 2nd push URL: git remote set-url --add --push all REMOTE-URL-2.
4) Push a branch to all the remotes with git push all BRANCH – replace BRANCH with a real branch name.


USE CASE 
1)it is easy to synchronize code between multiple git repositories, 
especially, pushing to multiple remotes. This is helpful when you’re maintaining mirrors 
 copies of the same repository. All you need to do is set up multiple push URLs on a remote 
and then perform git push to that remote as you usually do.
2) To have different versions for staging , testing , deployment processes
