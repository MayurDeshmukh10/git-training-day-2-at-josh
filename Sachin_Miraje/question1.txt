cherry-pick applies the changes introduced by perticular commits,rather then applying all commit's along a branch. 

Use Cases :-
When we want to undo the changes introduced by some commit
Combining multiple commit's into single commit 
Applying specific changes from one branch to another(when a backend developer is working on a data structure and bakend developer wants to access he can get he perticuler commit)

Steps :

git checkout main		#swithching to main branch

git cherry-pick <id> 	#the commit with id will be picked to main branch
