To set multiple repositories for the same project the following command can be used:-

git remote add <name_of_remote_repository> <url_of_remote>

Using multiple repositories is the only way to work efficiently. This enables each team to 
work independently, and do their work faster. Using this you can also make sure that 
developers only have access to the repositories they need access to. This makes git more 
secure.
